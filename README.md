For a project like this, a good README file serves as both documentation for other developers or users and a guide for future contributors to understand and interact with your code. Here’s a general structure and content suggestion for the README:

Data Structures Project: Singly Linked List and Stack

Project Description

This project is a C++ implementation of two fundamental data structures: a Singly Linked List (SLL) and a Stack. Users can interact with the data structures via a simple menu-driven interface, allowing them to perform various operations on both the linked list and the stack. The program enables users to:
	•	Add or remove elements from the list or stack.
	•	View the contents of each structure.
	•	Perform other common operations such as inserting at an index, popping elements, or checking if a structure is empty.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how these data structures function at a low level and to provide an educational tool for those looking to understand basic data structures in C++.

Features

Linked List
	•	Push Front: Add a value to the front of the list.
	•	Push Back: Add a value to the end of the list.
	•	Pop Front: Remove the value at the front of the list.
	•	Pop Back: Remove the value at the end of the list.
	•	Insert: Insert a value at a specified index in the list.
	•	Remove: Remove a value from a specified index.
	•	Find: Locate the index of a specified value.
	•	Check if Empty: Verify whether the list is empty.
	•	Display: Display all the elements in the list.
	•	View Front and Back Elements: View the first and last elements in the list.

Stack
	•	Push: Add a value to the top of the stack.
	•	Pop: Remove the top value from the stack.
	•	Check if Empty: Check whether the stack is empty.
	•	View Top Element: Display the top element without removing it.
	•	Find Average: Compute the average of all elements in the stack.
	•	Display Stack: View all elements currently in the stack.

Usage

Once the program is running, you can select between the linked list and the stack from the main menu. Each data structure has its own set of operations which can be accessed through the corresponding submenus.

Example:
	•	Selecting option 1 will take you to the Linked List menu, where you can choose to push, pop, or display the list, among other options.
	•	Selecting option 2 will switch to Stack operations, where you can push to or pop from the stack, or even calculate the average of the stack’s elements.
